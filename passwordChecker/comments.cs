        - its static because the password will always need to be a minlength of 8,
        - therefore all thats needed is to call it, "just getting a reference/'lookup'" for minlength.
        1 test:


       method returns nothing - used but result wont be stored in a variable:
        
        public void returnNothing(string something, int number)
        {
            }


        method returning answer - must return a int:

        public int returnAnswer(int number1, int number2)
        {
           answer = number1 * number2;
            return answer;
            }

        static method that won't return anything, will just be used:
        public static void returnNothing();

         */
    }
}
